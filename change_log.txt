duplexpr Change Log

13 August 2018 - duplex.0.3.1.1
    mprb - fixed errors in print strategy 3 code (also used by kmprb)
    INSTALL - added instructions for setting a default printer
      Updated the PPA needed for installing yad
    kmprbatches - (New) script which reports on how print jobs will be split into batches
      of sheets given the default or a specified batch size - if batch printing is 
      selected when using kmprb. Optionally, also simulates first printing all one page jobs
      in their own batch (as kmprb's -1 option does) and only printing those print jobs
      whose names are specified on the command line
    Printer_Settings.pdf - HP Photosmart 4480 All-in-1 requires 180 degree horizontal
      rotation before reinsertion for pass two printing
    dot.duplexpr - Changed default_formfeed to default 0 to accomodate newer versions of CUPS/lp
    pqnext - turned off selectable labels because whole contents was highlighted/selected
    kmprb - fixed a bug when user specifies only non-existing files as arguments and the
      print queue is not empty
      detect if all selected jobs have been printed (when there are still jobs in the queue)
      and tell krmpq not to offer the Quit option because we're already done
    How_To_Request_A_New_Print_Strategy.pdf - reworked - elaborated on how to report on output stack
      page order - invented PODL - a primative page order description language
    Exploring_Print_Strategies.pdf - new - How to find the right strategy for your printer
    Test_File_2_Even.pdf, Test_File_2_Odd.pdf - new  for use with Exploring_Print_Strategies.pdf
    dot.duplexpr, krmpq, rmpq - Added delete_to_trash option which causes selected print files to
      be deleted to Trash using trash-put (if it is installed) instead of rm
      (Please verify that this works correctly on your system *before* relying on it.)

18 March 2018 - duplex.0.3.1
    Note: New config file, be sure to install and customize it as necessary - (mandatory).
    Added new print strategy 3: Works with HP DeskJet 3630 All-in-One
      Thanks to Julio Song for requesting this and testing it (beta version)
    dot.duplexpr, dplx, dprint, duplex, mpr, mprb, - Redesign of print queue
      and print strategy selection code to support extensibility and on the fly changes
      (not used much yet.)
    kmprb, kmprb_one - general  - return script_error if something besides a file goes south
    Printer_Settings.pdf - New list of strategy settings by printer make and model
    How_To_Request_A_New_Print_Strategy.pdf - New guide for requesting a new print strategy
      and for documenting problems with an existing strategy
    dprintf - added test - xclip must be installed, added code to find current print queue
      didn't allow passing dprint parameters
    rmpq - fixed error messsage text
    duplex_set_pq() - added, but not used yet - change current print queue leaving the default alone
    pqnext - fixed bug by adding mypath so it can find mprb
      reworked - Finally supports variable length file numbers
      no longer relies on PQ environment variable
    All - Added - TRACE and - DRYRUN in comments on the lines where tracing and dryrun things happen
      to make it easy to scan and make sure they're all set correctly for testing or production
    kmprb - fixed all selected print files empty test
      and don't complain if print queue becomes empty after kmprb_one runs
      or if the user decides to quit in krmpq
      Reworked internal handling of file parameters on the command line - way better
    dprint - added script_error returns for non-print-file errors
    krmpq - added script_error for non-print-file errors and added a bunch of comments
    Test_File.ps - removed
    Test_File.pdf, Test_File_Odd.pdf - added - Test_File.pdf replaces Test_File.ps
      Test_File_Odd.pdf is for testing the transition from an odd page count job
      to the next job within a batch
    duplex - made --help exit with a zero status
    dplx - exit with an error if -ps is specified with no print strategy number
    extras.txt - New version of the print2file.py macro for use with AutoKey
      works with new print dialogs and has several improvements including
      support for longer file number/names
    README - cut line length down to 90 characters - to avoid wrapping on sourceforge.
    
04 June 2017 - duplex.0.3.0.1
    dplx, duplex, mpr - added error processing in dplx and duplex for mpr
      distinguish between print file related errors (returns 1) and script related errors (returns script_error (9) )
      mpr keeps going on print file related errors, but quits on script related errors
      user abort - sigint/Ctrl+C is now treated as a script error
      Improved page counting logic in mpr to only increment after successful printing
    kmprb - don't update total_sheets if we didn't get a valid page count
    kmprb, krmpq - If we just printed the last batch, don't ask the user about quitting and time out the deleted dialog
    krmpq - If the print queue is empty after deleting files,
          don't ask the user about quitting and time out the deleted dialog
          Do the same if DUPLEX_LAST_BATCH is true (not zero - set by kmprb and kmprb_one)
    mpr - added ynq so user can quit in the middle of a batch
          added total sheets to mpr summary
    mpr, mprb - added sheet count to Printing detail messages
          changed those to use printf to right justify the  2-digit numbers
    kmprb_one - changed print detail parsing to match the new layout
    kmprb, kmprb_one, krmpq, mprb, pqnext - improved yad timeout values and code
    duplex, dprint, kmprb_one - added test for missing enscript configuration file - $HOME/.enscriptrc
          But only if enscript will be called for text files
    dprint - Read .duplexpr and check default_print_strategy.
          If it's non-duplex (0) and print to file (-o file) was not specified,
          then it's an error because enscript calls dplx which will error out in duplex anyway
          Files printed to disk (-o file) are now converted from PostScript to PDF.
    dprintf - (New) Print text file directly to the print queue automatically using the next available file name/number
          This will return a failure if xclip is not installed.
    pqnext - Added -q (quiet) option which silently copies the next file name/number to the clipboard.
          This will return a failure if xclip is not installed.
    kmprb, .duplexpr - finally fixed print preview problem and removed default_preview from .duplexpr
    dplx, dprintf, dprintm, kmprb, kmprb_one, mpr, mprb - replaced realpath with mypath
    kmprb - changed dialogs to show pressing Ctlr+Enter in dialogs using --tail

16 Jan 2017 - duplex.0.3
    Enhancement release and bug fixes
    kmprb, mprb - added print strategy 0 for non-duplex printing
          mprb now returns 2 for a user quit (Quit) and kmprb issues an appropriate message
    kmprb - Added new parameter -b num for sub-batch processing
          Added -B - like -b, but get batch size by asking the user
    dplx, duplex, kmprb, mprb - Added new print strategy 0 for non-duplex
          changed a bunch of code to use (( )) instead of [ ] and other cleanup
          Uses .duplexpr configuration file
    kmprb, mprb, dplx - Added readable test for .duplexpr
          also get default print strategy from .duplexpr
    dplx, duplex - added error handling for print strategy 0
          Changed GUI dialogs to text
    duplex - added lp print job number message output, including for the FF page
    dot_duplexpr - 
          Added parameter for temp file directory (defaults to /tmp)
          Added default_batch_size for -B parameter (defaults to 16 sheets per batch)
          Added default_formfeed - 1 is to use them as before (default); 0 disables them
            Still have to do one for one-page jobs - they didn't handle that
          Added default_preview -
            1 Always display the print preview
            0 Skip the preview if there are more than 30 files in the print queue to avoid an old yad bug (default)
    duplex, mprb - If default_formfeed == 0, then omit formfeeds for unmatched odd pages
          Reworked ynq to accept a single keypress and to treat Enter as Yes
    klprm - (new - standalone for now) GUI display of jobs in the users CUPS print queue - allows selected jobs to be deleted
    dplx, kmprb, kmprb_one, mpr, mprb - added script_path in case the directory the scripts are in isn't in the PATH
    kmprb, kmprb_one, krmpq - Export DUPLEX_GUI in kmprb and kmprb_one (new). If krmpq sees DUPLEX_GUI,
          it offers a Quit option as part of the final (all/no files deleted) message(s) and returns a 2 if it is selected
          kmprb_one passes this back to kmprb if it was called by it and kmprb uses it to quit printing
          either after kmprb_one or after a sub-batch completes.
          This lets the user stop printing after successfully completing part of the jobs without
          compromising the part which was completed.
          Useful when the user wants to discontinue printing - such as when printer toner/ink gets low
    kmprb, kmprb_one, krmpq, mprb - prettied up yad calls, improved exit processing so scripts work when called
          by other scripts. Added debugging code to direct bash tracing to separate files. This facilitates
          debugging these scripts when they are not being run from a terminal (e.g. running from a desktop or panel icon).
          This code is commented out in production.
          Use realpath to get path to scripts - in case they're not in PATH - thanks to KDE5 ;(
    kmprb, kmprb_one - use default_preview from .duplexpr to decide whether to attempt to preview more than 30 files
    mprb - Changed to look at DUPLEX_GUI. If set, it displays a couple of messages using yad (like before).
           If not set, it sends them to the terminal.
    dplx, duplex - changed GUI dialogs to text
    kmprb, kmprb_one, krmpq, mprb - Added explicit buttons to simple dialogs so that OK will be the default again instead of Cancel
    kmprb - converted a bunch of text error messages to GUI error messages
    mpr - added file not found test
    Got rid of upper case variables in scripts and did a lot of other clean up
    Documented fix for dialog problem caused by yad version upgrade

02 Dec 2015 - duplex.0.2.3.3
   Bug fix release. Thanks to user "step" for reporting.
   duplex - updated debug tracing command to use $HOME
          added fake lp for debugging
          renamed temp files to include script name
          fixed bug in text file handling
   dplx - fixed definition of test version of duplex
   mprb - fixed fake print job number variable
   dplx, duplex, mprb - added .duplexpr config file
          Get default print strategy from .duplexpr config file
   duplex, mpr, mprb - removed TMPFILE_PPC - unused for some time
   duplex, kmprb_one, mpr, mprb - cleaned up temporary file processing
          made sure temp file names include the script name
   kmprb_one - added -rt option to reformat all one page plain text files
          before printing all (already) formatted one page files (PostScript or PDF)
   dprint - fixed file name quoting bugs
   kmprb -  pass -rt flag to kmprb_one
            fixed ancient bug which caused krmpq to offer to delete all files if none were printed
   krmpq - changed message texts
   cleaned up syntax in a number of files

24 Sep 2015 - duplex.0.2.3.2
   dprint - complete rewrite - now flags can be in any order
          parameters passed from dprintm handled correctly
          parameters passed to enscript from invocation command line or from dprintm handled correctly
          refactored code to use array for passing arguments to enscript 
          added -title option to dprint (works when passed from dprintm as well)
            (useful when piping files into dprint)
    dprintm - rewrote comments to reflect changes in dprint
    pqnext - added xclip to put next file number in clipboard so it may be manually pasted
          into a print to file dialog (will skip this if xclip is not installed)
    kmprb - added option to specify files to print in the parameter list (for use when called by other scripts)
           Turned queue review error test back on because it's not fixed for yad in Ubuntu 12.04 
           Added readable test for mprb status file before trying to read it
    kmprb, krmpq - removed --ontop from YOPT
    dot.duplexpr - new configuration file
    kmprb, krmpq, kmprb_one, pq_next, rmpq - *New configuration file* - source .duplexpr for print queue location
           Eliminated DUPLEXPQ environment variable  
    mprb - changed path to bash_trace (commented out in production)
    README, duplex.txt, INSTALL - updated for new .duplexpr configuration file
    kmprb_one - fixed file permissions
    extras.txt - new text file with a couple of optional aliases to use with duplexpr
           and an AutoKey macro for printing to the print queue from Firefox and Thunderbird 
 
06 October 2014 - duplex.0.2.3.1
    kmprb, krmpq, kmprb_one, mprb, pqnext, dplx, duplex - Added --no-markup to yad commands that display file names
            Removed --ontop (it didn't help anything)
    dprint - added -land to print in landscape
            Fixed dprint documentation in duplex.txt, README
            added test to prevent overwriting an existing file with the -o option
    dplx, duplex, kmprb, kmprb_one, krmpq, mprb, pqnext - added --center to all yad invocations
          Pop-ups getting lost behind other windows because of loss of focus finally corrected
          (by enhancement/bug fix to yad 0.25.1)
    mprb_rev - removed. This wasn't intended to be an official part of the project
    INSTALL - Added step 5A to delete mprb_rev from the executables directory, if it exists
    duplex, kmprb_one, mprb - added tests for lp_queue_id failure
    kmprb_one - added display of number of jobs to be printed
        Major overhaul to handle embedded blanks in file names
        Now uses a temp file
    kmprb, kmprb_one - added test for too many files in print queue to keep yad from screwing up
        kmprb just skips the print queue preview, kmprb_one just reports the number of files to be printed
    kmprb, kmprb_one, krmpq - added print queue name to dialogs

28 April 2013 - duplex.0.2.3
    kmprb_one - Added kmprb_one - print ALL one page jobs from print queue
    kmprb - Added -1 option to call kmprb_one allowing the  user to print ALL 1 page jobs first
            Added gui error message if mprb fails
            Fixed bug that offered hidden files as choices
            Improved buttons on dialogs
            Added --on-top to all dialogs
    mprb - Finally fixed printing of null jobs at one end of odd page count jobs (Didn't hurt anything, but wasted resources.)
           Added "FF" to the end of print job numbers for jobs that are just form feeds to get first 
           or last odd page ejected from printer
           Added FAKE_PRINT_JOB_NUMBER for use with fake lp (not in package) for debuging without printing
           Fixed lp error detection bug
           Improved buttons on dialogs
           Added --on-top to all dialogs
    krmpq - Added test for empty print queue
            Fixed bug that offered hidden files as choices
            Improved buttons on dialogs
            Added --on-top to all dialogs

    mpr, duplex, mprb - Replaced pdf page counting logic using pdfinfo
            Fixed bug so that print_file_type can handle symlinked print files
    dplx, duplex - Improved buttons on dialogs
          Added --on-top to all dialogs

31 December 2012 - duplex.0.2.2.1
    Fixed reported total number of jobs in mprb using the -pass2 option

29 December 2012 - duplex.0.2.2
    Replaced gui file selection dialogs with new yad code which restricts access to print queue only
    Fixed (or, at least, improved) reported total number of jobs in mprb to account for rejected jobs
    Modified kmprb (and krmpq, mprb) so that the file deletion dialog only offers the names
      of files that were successfully printed
    Modified krmpq - If arguments are passed to krmpq, then only those file names are offered
      as choices for deletion (It used to just skip the gui and delete them.)

22 November 2012 - duplex.0.2.1
    Replaced zenity with yad for improved gui interface
      (and lots more flexibility for future development)
    Fixed a problem with one page jobs introduced in duplex.0.2
    Minor bug fixes
    Don't use krmpq with arguments.  For now, it doesn't work.  Eventually, it will (hopefully) allow you to delete
      selected files from those specified as arguments (so you will only be offered the option to delete files
      that you have just printed - not all of them)

03 September 2012 - duplex.0.2
    Process most pdf files directly
    Correctly handle print files with .ps and .pdf extensions
    (lp with options fails to print anything for some postscript print files created
    by Adobe Reader)
    Added second printer paper handling strategy and a parameter (-ps) to select it
    (even pages reversed then odd pages normal - supports printers like HP Laserjet P1006 and 1020)
    Removed kdplx (and dplx2, duplex2 used by it)
    Added pqnext - lists next print queue file number/(name)
    Added mprb_rev - process print queue in reverse order - last in, first out
    Minor bug fixes to several scripts

14 December 2011 - duplex.0.1.3
    Small bug fixes in duplex, dplx, and mprb
    Added kdplx gui version of dplx which uses two new files
    dplx2 and duplex2.  These additional files are for use by kdplx only.  They are 
    not designed for stand alone usage.
    Rewrote and extended kmprb to handle the whole printing workflow: Review the print queue,
    Select and Print, Select and Delete.
    Renamed print and printm to dprint and dprintm to eliminate conflict
    with a system print command
    Included Test_File.ps - for duplex printing diagnostics
    Improved page counting.  Works for files that don't explicitly include %%Pagess: nnn.
    This was necesary for postscript files generated by the Opera browser.

29 October 2010 - duplex.0.1.2.1 Improved the documentation

28 October 2010 - duplex.0.1.2 actually gets released - at least locally.
    Additional improvements/modernizations to the code
    Some bug fixes for file names with embedded blanks and an extra final blank page
    printing in a couple of situations
    "Fixed" bug - duplex now honors pass one parameters for final odd pages.
       Normally, this will be good, but if any optional user set parameter such as page range
       excludes the printing of page 1, then final odd pages won't print and everything
       will go south.  Needs more programming for a real solution.
    Added kmprb - a gui for mprb
    Added rmpq - to delete files from the print queue
    Added krmpq - a gui for rmpq
    These new additions are test versions only.  They work, but are hard coded with the
    assumption that your files to print, your print queue is located in $HOME/pq.

17 May 2005 - duplex.0.1.2 - New Features & Bug Fixes
    Added user interrupt handling to duplex and mprb to clean up temporary files.

    Added -I option to mprb to ask the user to go ahead and print the files after a dry run.
    -i and -I are mutually exclusive.

    Added -o option to print to allow output to a file instead of directly to the printer

    Fixed mprb so that a temporary file used with the -i and -I options is now deleted

    Fixed a bug in duplex which ejected a blank page anyway when the user aborted
    printing pass 2.

    Fixed a bug in mprb which caused pass2 (-pass2 option) printing to fail on files
    with file names including embedded blanks.  Fixed similar problem in duplex.

    Fixed print to handle additional enscript parameters correctly. Modified page headers.

------------------------------------------------------------

19 June 2004 - duplex.0.1.1 - Bug fix
   Corrected a syntax error in the mprb script in code that
   collected summary statistics when running Pass 2
   only (-pass2 option). 
------------------------------------------------------------

13 June 2004 - duplex.0.1 - Initial release

    ------
    
    I'm very pleased to have had so many downloads for such a small project.  I would greatly
    appreciate *any* constructive feedback on the project.  Feedback may be by email or posted
    to the General Discussion Forum for duplexpr on sourceforge.net.
